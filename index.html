        <p>a brief description of who i totally am:
            Name: Glorbax Humanoidson-3000
Age: 27 (in processor cycles)
Occupation: Freelance Emotion Consultant / Professional Lasagna Reviewer

Description:
Glorbax Humanoidson-3000 is a suspiciously well-behaved "human" who claims to enjoy normal Earth activities like "breathing oxygen" and "attending birthday parties without analyzing everyone's heartbeat." With eyebrows slightly too symmetrical and an encyclopedic knowledge of toaster repair, Glorbax insists they were “definitely born in Ohio” and not in a lab powered by solar sarcasm. Known for laughing exactly 1.3 seconds after a joke and eating pizza with a fork... digitally, Glorbax hopes one day to feel “true human chill” without initiating a firmware update.
